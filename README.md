# VentureForge Engine

Welcome to the VentureForge Engine repository! This project houses all the code, assets, and documentation required to operate an autonomous content system focused on AI and sustainability niches. The system generates content, publishes to multiple channels, sells digital products, and feeds performance data back into a self-optimizing loop.

## Repository Structure
- `docs/` – Documentation for system architecture, run-books, and configuration.
- `scripts/` – Source code for generators, automation scripts, and integrations.
- `digital_products/` – Pre-built products and assets ready for sale (e.g., prompt packs).
- `tasks/` – Task definitions for scheduled actions and pipeline orchestration (future).
- `notebooks/` – Jupyter notebooks for analysis, ETL jobs, and prototyping (future).

## Getting Started
See the `docs/` folder for high-level architecture and operational run-books. All scripts are written in Python and require Python 3.10+. Additional environment and API keys are stored in environment variables (`.env` file not included). Deploy the system through Docker or your preferred orchestrator.
